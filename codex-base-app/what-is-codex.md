# What is Codex?

The Codex app, adapted from the renowned VS Code, serves as our strong foundation. By building upon this successful tool, we empower translators to test new functionalities on an already complete editor. This approach enables us to provide a seamless and familiar environment for translators to work in.

By forking VS Code, we're seeking to rapidly innovate and integrate existing tools into a single context for translators.
