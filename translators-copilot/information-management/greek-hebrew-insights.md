# Greek/Hebrew Insights

We want to provide source language insights to translators via the intuitive social interface of a chat conversation.

Being able to "chat with the source texts" will provide an invaluable tool to translators, who will no longer need to wade through pages and complex search interfaces, only to be left with a set of data points that do not obviously answer their questions.&#x20;

Furthermore, by including references to the source data itself or relevant documents for further reading, we can help empower translators without great familiarity with the source texts to begin to interact with standard Greek and Hebrew resources.

You can turn a long list of datapoints into readable and targeted insights
