# Streamlining the Translation Process

We aim to streamline the translation process by providing contextual information to simplify problem solving and reduce context switching for translators. This includes:

* Offering real-time suggestions for translations
* Providing immediate troubleshooting assistance
* Offering solutions for common translation problems
* Provide just-in-time source language insights via chat/audio

Streamlining the translation process can also involve automating relevant tasks, much like how social media management tools allow businesses or influencers to post across multiple platforms simultaneously.&#x20;

Automation or [orchestration](../../translators-copilot/orchestration/ "mention") includes:

* Automating repetitive tasks in the translation process
* Allowing batch processing
* Streamlining workflow by integrating with other tools (e.g., Greek Room, etc.)
