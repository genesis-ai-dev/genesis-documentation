# Powerful Tools and Simplicity

### Principles from Ubiquitous Computing

From ["Computer Science Challenges for the Next 10 Years"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jwLWosmmjE) (Mark Weiser 1996)

* The purpose of a computer is to help you do something else.
* The best computer is a quiet, invisible servant.
* The more you can do by intuition the smarter you are; the computer should extend your unconscious.
* Technology should create calm.
