# Unopinionated Assistance

Project Acclerate aims to be _relatively_ unopinionated. What does this mean?

Our tools do not enforce a specific translation style, cultural context, theological perspective, or set of file formats for data or projects. Instead, the tools adapt to your unique translation style and project context. This includes:

* Learning from your translations and adjusting suggestions based on your patterns and conventions
* Providing personalized assistance via chat&#x20;
* Localization (UI and AI)
* Tool agnostic integration wherever possible
