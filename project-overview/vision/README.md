# Vision

The vision of Project Accelerate is to develop innovative translation-assistance technology rapidly.

To accomplish this vision, we are building [Broken link](broken-reference "mention"), a set of tools powered by emerging AI technology and established NLP techniques.&#x20;

The vision of Project Accelerate is to make translation software recede into the background as much as possible, to **make the translation project the centre of focus**, and to **make the tools of translation as intuitive as translating**.

We will accomplish this vision by:

* Combining powerful tools and interface simplicity
* Reducing friction by streamlining the translation process
* Being relatively un-opinionated
