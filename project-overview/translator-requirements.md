# Translator Requirements

We would like this project's [roadmap.md](roadmap.md "mention") and priorities to be driven by translator needs, not available technology, existing tools, or sunk costs.

Joel and Ulf authored a research paper about translator needs, and they had some important summaries:

> Finding accurate meaning and context for words or phrases (including figures-of-speech) unfamiliar to the translators was reported as difficult and as a time-sink. Dictionaries were helpful though seeing relevant pictures would be better (e.g. for the word ephod). There are, however, legitimate instances where this process could take time. Especially, if there did not exist an equivalent term in the target language. e.g. ’yeast’ was unknown to one of the target language communities.
>
> There is a need for a resource that lists cultural references in the Bible with their location and significance. e.g. Exchanging slippers to make a covenant in the book of Ruth. It was noted that having access to good resources empower the lingual church to take ownership and more responsibility of the translation process.

Based on Joel and Ulf's research paper about translator needs, here is a list of proposed features for a translation app tailored to those needs:

1. **Contextual Meaning Finder**: An advanced tool that helps in finding the accurate meaning and context of words or phrases, especially those unfamiliar to the translator. This feature would be particularly useful for idiomatic expressions and figures of speech.
2. **Visual Dictionary Integration**: For words or concepts that are difficult to translate or understand, such as 'ephod', the app could provide relevant images to assist in comprehension.
3. **Cultural Reference Guide**: A comprehensive resource within the app that lists cultural references found in specific texts, like the Bible. This would include the location and significance of each reference, for example, the exchanging of slippers in the book of Ruth. Translation Core resources are probably the best place to start in this regard.
4. **Target Language Term Finder**: A feature that addresses the issue when there is no equivalent term in the target language. This tool could suggest approximate translations, offer descriptive alternatives, or provide cultural notes for terms like 'yeast' that may not exist in the target language.
5. **Translation Community Forum**: A platform where translators can discuss and share insights about challenging translations, cultural nuances, and other translation-related issues. This would empower the linguistic community with shared knowledge and responsibility in the translation process.
6. **Resource Library for Churches**: A dedicated section providing resources to churches, enabling them to take greater ownership and responsibility in the translation process. This library could include guides, translation best practices, and cultural insights. - I believe the Bible Aquifer will be fulfilling this requirement.
7. **Real-Time Collaboration Tools**: To facilitate teamwork among translators, especially when working on complex or culturally sensitive texts.
8. **Customizable Interface for Various Translator Needs**: An adaptable user interface that can be tailored to individual translator preferences and needs, enhancing efficiency and ease of use. - We believe the [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")will accomplish this aim.
9. **Continuous Learning and Update Feature**: The app should have a mechanism to learn from user inputs and evolve, integrating new words, phrases, and cultural references as they become relevant in various languages. - We believe [In-context learning](https://ryder.dev/translating-with-ai/) and [translation-memory.md](../translators-copilot/orchestration/translation-memory.md "mention") make this possible.
10. **Offline Access Capability**: Considering that translators might work in remote areas with limited internet connectivity, the app should provide robust offline access to its key features. Cf. [project-philosophy.md](project-philosophy.md "mention")

### Requirements Categories

I have broken down our understanding of translator requirements into three main buckets:

* [information-management](../translators-copilot/information-management/ "mention")
* [translation-assistance](../translators-copilot/translation-assistance/ "mention")
* [orchestration](../translators-copilot/orchestration/ "mention") - This bucket assumes basic functionality in the previous two buckets
